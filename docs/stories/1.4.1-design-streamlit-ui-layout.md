# Story 1.4.1 – Design Streamlit UI Layout

## Purpose
Define an intuitive layout for the Streamlit dashboard that presents queries and insights effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Wireframes or sketches produced showing desktop and mobile layouts. (See `docs/ui/streamlit-hero-layout.md` for the written spec reflecting the designer mock.)
- [x] Layout includes sections for query input, pain point summaries, metadata, and error notifications. (Spec documents hero, results container, diagnostics panel, and future filter placement.)
- [x] Accessibility considerations documented (contrast ratio, keyboard navigation focus order). (Captured under “Accessibility Notes” in the spec.)
- [x] Design aligns with template styling preference noted by the team. (Color tokens, typography, and logo treatment mirror the provided design.)
- [ ] Sign-off from product owner recorded before implementation begins.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Design Review**: Walkthrough with stakeholders; capture feedback and revision history.
- [ ] **Accessibility Audit**: Evaluate planned components against WCAG AA guidelines.
- [x] **Feasibility Check**: Developers confirm components map cleanly to Streamlit primitives. (Spec maps design sections to `st.container`, `st.columns`, custom CSS, and callback tooling.)
