# Story 2.2.3 – Implement Google data parsing

## Purpose
Convert raw Google Custom Search API responses into a consistent schema consumable by the pain point extractor and UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Parser extracts core fields (title, snippet, url, display link, publication date when available).
- [x] Result ranking and search metadata included to support later scoring and deduplication.
- [x] HTML entities and markup stripped or decoded to present clean text.
- [x] Parser tags each result with `platform="google_search"` and ensures timestamps are normalized to ISO 8601 when present.
- [x] Graceful handling of missing fields or unsupported result types (images, videos) through filtering or annotation.

## Test Criteria
- [x] **Unit Tests**: Provide fixtures for standard web results, news results with dates, and items missing optional fields; assert normalized outputs.
- [x] **Error Handling Test**: Simulate malformed payloads to confirm parser logs warnings and skips entries without raising.
- [x] **Schema Validation**: Validate normalized payloads against the cross-source schema defined in Phase 1 stories.
