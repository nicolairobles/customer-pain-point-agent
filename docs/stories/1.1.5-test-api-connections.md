# Story 1.1.5 – Test API Connections

## Purpose
Validate connectivity to OpenAI and Reddit services to de-risk downstream development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Smoke test scripts exist for OpenAI and Reddit, committed under `scripts/` or `tests/fixtures/`.
- Both scripts succeed using credentials from `.env`.
- Failures produce actionable error messages logged to console.
- Test results documented in project tracking tool with timestamp and tester name.
- Retries and timeout guidance captured for future automation.

## Test Criteria
- **Execution**: Run the OpenAI and Reddit smoke scripts back-to-back; both exit with status code 0.
- **Logging**: Review logs for masked secrets and inclusion of request IDs where available.
- **Automation Prep**: Integrate scripts into CI dry run (if available) to confirm they can be executed headlessly.
