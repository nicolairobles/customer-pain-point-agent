# Story 1.1.2 – Set Up Python Virtual Environment

## Purpose
Provide an isolated Python runtime with all project dependencies installed to enable reproducible development across contributors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Local environment uses Python 3.10+ as specified in `README.md`.
- [x] Virtual environment (`.venv/` or agreed name) is created and excluded from version control.
- [x] `pip install -r requirements.txt` completes without errors.
- [x] `python -m pip list` shows versions matching dependency constraints.
- [x] Activation and deactivation steps are recorded in `docs/setup.md`.

## Test Criteria
- [x] **Setup Script**: Run documented commands on a clean machine; environment activation succeeds.
- [x] **Dependency Import**: Launch Python shell within the venv and `import langchain`, `streamlit`, `praw` without ImportError.
- [x] **Isolation Check**: Deactivate the venv and confirm project-specific packages are not available globally.
