# Story 2.2.2 – Implement Google search tool

## Purpose
Deliver a Google search integration that issues Custom Search queries, normalizes the top results, and feeds them into the agent pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `google_search_tool.py` implements `_run`/`_arun` leveraging the official Google Custom Search REST endpoint.
- [x] Tool accepts query text plus optional parameters for result count, language, and site restrictions.
- [x] Responses normalized to include title, snippet, url, display url, published date (if available), and search ranking position.
- [x] Handles quota exhaustion by retrying with exponential backoff and logging actionable warnings.
- [x] Structured logging masks API keys and captures request latency metrics.

## Test Criteria
- [x] **Unit Tests**: Mock HTTP responses for success, zero results, and quota errors; assert normalization and exception paths.
- [x] **Integration Test**: Execute a live query with a low-cost keyword and verify at least five normalized results are returned.
- [x] **Performance Test**: Benchmark execution time; 95th percentile latency stays under 10 seconds for five queries.
