# Story 1.3.2 – Implement Pain Point Extractor

## Purpose
Develop the module that orchestrates LLM calls to transform raw documents into structured pain points.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `extract_pain_points` consumes list of normalized documents and returns validated Pydantic models.
- Implements batching to respect token limits and minimize latency.
- Includes deduplication, sentiment scoring, and frequency calculation logic.
- Errors surfaced with actionable messages and fallback behavior (partial results + warnings).
- Logging captures cost estimates and token usage per run.

## Test Criteria
- **Unit Tests**: Mock LLM responses to cover success, partial failure, and invalid JSON scenarios.
- **Performance Test**: Process dataset of at least 30 documents within the 2-minute response goal.
- **Quality Check**: Manual review of outputs ensures pain points include name, description, frequency, examples, and sources.
