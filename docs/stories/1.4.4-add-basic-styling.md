# Story 1.4.4 – Add Basic Styling

## Purpose
Apply cohesive styling to the Streamlit application to improve usability and align with brand guidelines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Global CSS overrides implemented (via `st.markdown` or `.streamlit/config.toml`) using the preferred template from prior work.
- [x] Colors, typography, and spacing reflect design spec with documented variables.
- [x] Mobile responsiveness verified for major sections.
- [x] Dark mode considerations addressed where applicable.
- [x] Styling approach documented for future contributors (where to modify, theming constraints).

## Test Criteria
- [x] **Visual QA**: Capture before/after screenshots on desktop and mobile; share with stakeholders for approval. (See `docs/design/1.4.4-design.png`.)
- [x] **Regression Test**: Run Cypress or visual regression (if available) to ensure layout stability. (Covered via `pytest tests/test_theme.py`.)
- [x] **Performance Check**: Confirm styling changes do not introduce noticeable load delays in Streamlit app.
