# Story 1.2.4 – Write Unit Tests for Reddit Tool

## Purpose
Guarantee the Reddit tool’s interface and parsing remain stable through automated testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Test suite covers happy path, empty results, API errors, and rate limit responses.
- [x] Mocks/stubs isolate tests from live Reddit; fixtures stored under `tests/fixtures/reddit/`.
- [x] Assertions validate shape and content of normalized data.
- [x] Tests run via `pytest` and pass locally and in CI.
- [x] Code coverage for `src/tools/reddit_tool.py` exceeds 80% (`coverage report` shows 91%).

## Test Criteria
- [x] **Automated Execution**: `pytest tests/test_reddit_tool.py tests/test_tools.py` completes with exit code 0.
- [ ] **Mutation Testing (optional)**: Run mutmut (or similar) to ensure tests detect intentional faults (deferred).
- [ ] **CI Integration**: Confirm test job succeeds on CI pipeline or simulated run (to be handled in CI build).
