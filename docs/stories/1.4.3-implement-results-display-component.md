# Story 1.4.3 – Implement Results Display Component

## Purpose
Render extracted pain points and metadata in Streamlit with clear hierarchy and interaction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Component displays each pain point with name, description, frequency, examples, and source citations.
- Supports expandable sections or tabs for detailed views and maintains responsiveness.
- Metadata section summarizes total sources searched, execution time, and cost.
- Handles empty states, partial results, and errors gracefully.
- Styling matches the adopted UI template and includes basic theming overrides.

## Test Criteria
- **Unit/Component Tests**: Use sample datasets to ensure rendering logic handles diverse inputs.
- **Manual QA**: Load Streamlit app, verify formatting on desktop and mobile.
- **Accessibility Check**: Confirm headings/ARIA attributes support assistive technologies.
