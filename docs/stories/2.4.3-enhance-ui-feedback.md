# Story 2.4.3 – Enhance UI feedback and status messaging

## Purpose
Improve user trust by surfacing clear loading indicators, partial results messaging, and cost estimations in the Streamlit app.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Introduce a prominent loading state while the agent runs, including estimated wait time when available.
- [ ] Display partial results banners when one or more sources fail, referencing Story 2.3.3 fallback messaging.
- [ ] Show per-request API cost estimates sourced from instrumentation hooks.
- [ ] Error sections provide copy guidance and troubleshooting steps (e.g., refresh, adjust filters).
- [ ] UI strings reviewed for accessibility (contrast, ARIA labels) and documented in the style guide.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **UI Test**: Capture screenshots/GIFs of loading, success, partial failure, and error states.
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Trigger simulated tool failures and confirm banners align with backend signals.
- [ ] **Accessibility Review**: Run Streamlit’s accessibility checker (or manual audit) to validate contrast ratios and ARIA usage.
