# Story 2.3.3 – Add multi-source resilience

## Purpose
Improve the agent’s robustness when orchestrating multiple external tools by introducing concurrency controls, timeout management, and fallback strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement configurable concurrency (parallel vs sequential) for tool execution with sane defaults.
- [ ] Global timeout handling added so total agent execution respects `settings.agent.total_timeout_seconds`.
- [ ] Retries configured per tool with circuit breaker logic to prevent repeated failures.
- [ ] Fallback messaging supplied to the UI when a source is unavailable, including recommended remediation steps.
- [ ] Observability hooks emit structured events for success/failure per tool to aid monitoring.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Simulate tool timeouts and failures to confirm retries and circuit breaking behave as expected.
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Run orchestrator with one tool deliberately failing and verify fallback data reaches the UI.
- [ ] **Load Test**: Execute concurrent agent requests (>=5) and ensure no deadlocks or runaway tasks.
