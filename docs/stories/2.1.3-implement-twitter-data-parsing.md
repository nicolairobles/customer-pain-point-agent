# Story 2.1.3 – Implement Twitter data parsing

## Purpose
Transform raw Twitter API responses into the normalized schema expected by the agent, ensuring safety filtering and metadata completeness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parsing routine extracts required fields (text, author, url, timestamp, like count, repost count, reply count, language).
- [ ] Retweets and duplicates are de-duplicated or flagged based on tweet IDs.
- [ ] Content sanitization removes URLs, markdown-unsafe characters, and PII per logging guidelines.
- [ ] Normalization injects source metadata (`platform="twitter"`) and converts timestamps to ISO 8601 UTC.
- [ ] Parser gracefully handles missing fields or media-only tweets by skipping or annotating them.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Provide fixture responses for standard tweets, retweets, and tweets with missing fields; assert normalized outputs.
- [ ] **Error Handling Test**: Simulate malformed payloads to confirm parser logs warnings without raising unexpected exceptions.
- [ ] **Data Quality Test**: Validate that normalized payloads satisfy the interface contract from Story 2.1.1 using a schema validator.
