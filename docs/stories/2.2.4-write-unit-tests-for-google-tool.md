# Story 2.2.4 – Write unit tests for Google tool

## Purpose
Provide regression-resistant automated tests for the Google search tool and parser to safeguard against API or schema changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Tests exercise success, zero-result, quota-exceeded, and malformed response scenarios.
- [x] Fixtures use sanitized sample responses saved under `tests/fixtures/google/`.
- [x] Assertions verify that logging omits API keys while still including correlation identifiers and latency metrics.
- [x] Coverage report shows ≥80% line coverage for Google search modules.
- [x] Tests run as part of CI without making live network calls by default.

## Test Criteria
- [x] **Pytest Suite**: New tests reside under `tests/test_google_tool.py` with clear naming and parametrization.
- [x] **CI Dry Run**: Execute `pytest` locally with `-k google` to confirm deterministic behavior and no external dependencies.
- [x] **Failure Injection Test**: Temporarily modify normalization logic to ensure tests fail when schema expectations change.
