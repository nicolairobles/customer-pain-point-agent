# Story 1.2.1 – Design Reddit API Wrapper Interface

## Purpose
Define a clear abstraction for Reddit data access that the agent and tests can depend on.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Interface signature documented (methods, parameters, return schema) using docstrings or protocol classes.
- Data model accommodates required fields: title, body, url, author, subreddit, timestamp, score.
- Error handling strategy (exceptions vs error objects) is specified.
- Pagination, rate limiting, and query parameter options outlined.
- Design reviewed with backend team, and approval noted in project log.

## Test Criteria
- **Design Review**: Run through example queries ensuring interface covers positive and negative cases.
- **Schema Validation**: Serialize a sample response to JSON; confirm it matches planned Pydantic model.
- **Traceability**: Update `docs/work-breakdown.md` link and ensure interface decisions captured in `docs/architecture.md`.
