# Story 1.1.4 – Obtain Reddit API Credentials

## Purpose
Enable authenticated Reddit data retrieval required for the agent's discovery workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Reddit script application is created with descriptive name and redirect URI per documentation.
- `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` and `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` fields populated in local `.env`.
- Credentials validated using a simple PRAW script that authenticates without errors.
- Rate limit and usage guidelines captured in `docs/api_setup.md`.
- Access details (owner, scopes, created date) logged in the team's credential registry.

## Test Criteria
- **Authentication Test**: Run `python scripts/reddit_auth_check.py` to confirm `praw.Reddit` client returns the authenticated user.
- **Security Test**: Ensure secrets are absent from git history (`git log -p` shows no leakage).
- **Documentation Review**: Verify instructions in `docs/api_setup.md` cover renewal/rotation process.
