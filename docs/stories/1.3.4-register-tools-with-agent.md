# Story 1.3.4 – Register Tools with Agent

## Purpose
Ensure all external data source tools are properly registered and discoverable by the LangChain agent.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Tool definitions expose accurate `name`, `description`, and argument schemas.
- Agent registration occurs in a single orchestrator module with isolated configuration logic.
- Tools can be toggled on/off via settings for debugging or feature flags.
- Documentation describes how new tools should be added following the same pattern.
- Telemetry hooks capture which tools were invoked during each run.

## Test Criteria
- **Unit Tests**: Validate tool registry returns expected set given configuration toggles.
- **Integration Test**: Run agent with each tool enabled individually to confirm compatibility.
- **Logging Review**: Inspect logs to ensure tool invocation metadata is captured without leaking credentials.
