# Story 1.3.5 – Implement Agent Query Processing

## Purpose
Build the end-to-end query handling flow that ties user input, tool invocation, and extraction into a cohesive response.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `run_agent` validates input, invokes the agent, and normalizes output to the documented JSON schema.
- [x] Includes retry logic for transient tool failures with exponential backoff.
- [x] Captures execution metadata (duration, tools used, cost estimates) in returned payload.
- [x] Errors presented in structured format with remediation tips for end users.
- [ ] Supports streaming responses for UI components requiring live updates.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Mock underlying agent to validate normalization logic and error pathways.
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Execute representative queries exercising multiple tools; verify metadata fields populated.
- [ ] **Performance Test**: Confirm average end-to-end execution stays within 2-minute SLA.
