# Story 1.3.1 – Design Pain Point Extraction Prompt

## Purpose
Craft a robust LLM prompt that yields structured pain point insights from aggregated social data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Prompt template includes clear system instructions, input formatting, and expected JSON schema.
- [x] Guidance covers tone, conciseness, frequency scoring rubric, and citation requirements.
- [x] Prompt validated against sample Reddit/Twitter/Google snippets producing consistent outputs.
- [x] Stored under `src/extractors/prompts/` (or similar) with version history tracked.
- [ ] Peer review conducted to ensure prompt mitigates hallucinations and bias.

## Test Criteria
- [x] **Prompt Dry Run**: Execute prompt with at least three diverse datasets; outputs pass schema validation.
- [x] **Bias Check**: Review outputs for sensitive content handling; document mitigation steps if needed.
- [x] **Regression Harness**: Add prompt to automated test that diffs output schema after future changes.
