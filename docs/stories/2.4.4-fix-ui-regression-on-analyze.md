# Story 2.4.4 – Fix UI regression on Analyze

## Purpose
Ensure the Streamlit app consistently renders the updated UI design across reruns, including after the user clicks Analyze.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] On first load, the updated design renders as expected.
- [ ] After clicking Analyze, the app does not switch to the legacy design (no “flash”/re-render into old layout/styling).
- [ ] Analyze-triggered reruns preserve UI configuration (layout, theme/styling injection, component hierarchy) and session state.
- [ ] Root cause identified and documented (e.g., conditional render paths, duplicated layout code, `st.rerun()`/session state interactions).
- [ ] Manual verification performed on at least Chrome + Safari (or Firefox) to confirm consistent behavior.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Repro Capture**: Record a short GIF/screen recording showing the initial load vs post-Analyze behavior before/after the fix.
- [ ] **UI Regression Check**: Refresh, run Analyze multiple times, and confirm the design stays consistent across reruns.
- [ ] **Smoke Test**: Run a normal analysis end-to-end and verify results rendering and status messaging still work.
