# 5.1.2 – Implement dependency update automation (Dependabot / Renovate)

## Summary (Work Breakdown)

- **Description:** Research and propose an automated dependency update bot strategy
- **Work Package:** 5.1 Dependency Management & Maintenance
- **Duration:** 2 hours
- **Owner(s):** TBD

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Compare Dependabot and Renovate for GitHub workflow fit (language coverage, scheduling, grouping capabilities).
- [ ] Document recommended tool, update cadence (e.g., monthly LangChain/LLM deps), and notification strategy in `docs/project-mgmt`.
- [ ] Draft configuration file (e.g., `.github/dependabot.yml` or `renovate.json`) checked into a feature branch for review.
- [ ] Identify repos/branches included in automation and note any exclusions (e.g., pinned agent branches).

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Review:** Share findings and proposed config with the team for sign-off.
- [ ] **Dry Run:** If feasible, run the tool in preview mode (Dependabot PR or Renovate dry-run) to validate configuration before enabling.

# Notes
- Coordinate with LangChain upgrade issue 5.1.1 so automated PRs align with future migration work.
- Ensure secrets/permissions requirements are captured for whoever enables the bot.
