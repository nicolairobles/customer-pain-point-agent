## Detailed Story

# Story 2.2.3 – Implement Google data parsing

## Purpose
Convert raw Google Custom Search API responses into a consistent schema consumable by the pain point extractor and UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parser extracts core fields (title, snippet, url, display link, publication date when available).
- [ ] Result ranking and search metadata included to support later scoring and deduplication.
- [ ] HTML entities and markup stripped or decoded to present clean text.
- [ ] Parser tags each result with `platform=\"google_search\"` and ensures timestamps are normalized to ISO 8601 when present.
- [ ] Graceful handling of missing fields or unsupported result types (images, videos) through filtering or annotation.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Provide fixtures for standard web results, news results with dates, and items missing optional fields; assert normalized outputs.
- [ ] **Error Handling Test**: Simulate malformed payloads to confirm parser logs warnings and skips entries without raising.
- [ ] **Schema Validation**: Validate normalized payloads against the cross-source schema defined in Phase 1 stories.
