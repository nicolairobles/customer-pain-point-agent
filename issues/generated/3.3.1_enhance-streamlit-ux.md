# 3.3.1 – Enhance Streamlit UX

## Summary (Work Breakdown)

- **Description:** Elevate the Streamlit experience with refined layout, accessibility improvements, and responsive affordances aligned with the designer's PDF.
- **Work Package:** 3.3 UI/UX Improvements
- **Duration:** 2 hours
- **Owner(s):** TBD

- **Context:** Stories 1.4.1–1.4.4 established the hero layout, inputs, and base styling. Phase 3 pushes usability by tightening component spacing, improving accessibility semantics, and layering micro-interactions (e.g., skeleton loading) so the app feels production-ready.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit components for accessibility: ensure headings follow semantic order, add ARIA labels where Streamlit defaults fall short, and verify focus states comply with WCAG 2.1 AA.
- [ ] Implement loading and empty-state skeletons for the results display to smooth transitions during longer agent runs.
- [ ] Add responsive breakpoints beyond the hero (e.g., metadata metrics stacking, tabs collapsing) using shared CSS variables in `app/theme.py`.
- [ ] Introduce a global notification/toast pattern for success and info events, reusing the design tokens defined in the 1.4.x stories.
- [ ] Capture the updated UI spec (screenshots + annotations) in `docs/ui/streamlit-enhancements.md`, highlighting deviations from the Phase 1 hero brief.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Manual UX Sweep:** Use the Developer UX checklist (extend in `docs/ui/streamlit-hero-layout.md`) across three viewport sizes; document findings in this issue.
- [ ] **Accessibility Test:** Run automated scanning via `axe-core` (or Streamlit's built-in accessibility tools) and record remediation actions.
- [ ] **Unit/Smoke Tests:** Extend `tests/test_theme.py` or add a new snapshot test to ensure new CSS fragments load without regression.

## Notes
- Align with the designer on any net-new components before implementation to avoid rework.
- Consider adding a feature flag to toggle enhanced animations for environments with reduced motion preferences.
