## Detailed Story

# Story 1.2.3 – Implement Reddit Data Parsing

## Purpose
Normalize Reddit API responses into the project’s structured document format for downstream processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Parser function accepts raw PRAW submission/comment objects and outputs dicts matching extractor schema.
- [x] Includes sanitization for markdown, URLs, and user mentions.
- [x] Time fields converted to ISO8601 strings in UTC.
- [x] Handles missing/NSFW content gracefully, tagging records accordingly.
- [x] Comprehensive docstrings describe all fields and assumptions.

## Test Criteria
- [x] **Unit Tests**: Provide fixtures covering posts, comments, deleted authors, and media links; expect correct normalization.
- [x] **Edge Cases**: Validate parser handles empty bodies and long text (>10k chars) without crash.
- [x] **Schema Compliance**: Pass output through Pydantic model to ensure validation succeeds.
