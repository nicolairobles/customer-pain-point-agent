## Detailed Story

# Story 1.2.3 – Implement Reddit Data Parsing

## Purpose
Normalize Reddit API responses into the project’s structured document format for downstream processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parser function accepts raw PRAW submission/comment objects and outputs dicts matching extractor schema.
- [ ] Includes sanitization for markdown, URLs, and user mentions.
- [ ] Time fields converted to ISO8601 strings in UTC.
- [ ] Handles missing/NSFW content gracefully, tagging records accordingly.
- [ ] Comprehensive docstrings describe all fields and assumptions.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Provide fixtures covering posts, comments, deleted authors, and media links; expect correct normalization.
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Validate parser handles empty bodies and long text (>10k chars) without crash.
- [ ] **Schema Compliance**: Pass output through Pydantic model to ensure validation succeeds.
