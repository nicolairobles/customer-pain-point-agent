## Detailed Story

# Story 1.3.3 – Initialize LangChain Agent

## Purpose
Stand up the core LangChain agent that will coordinate tool usage and prompt execution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Agent constructed using `AgentExecutor` or equivalent with configurable parameters (max iterations, verbosity).
- [ ] Integrates with OpenAI wrapper, Reddit/Twitter/Google tools, and extractor pipeline.
- [ ] Supports both `invoke` and `stream` interfaces for batch and interactive use.
- [ ] Configuration options pulled from `config/settings.py` with sane defaults.
- [ ] Initialization logic documented in `docs/architecture.md` with sequence diagram or bullet summary.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Mock tools/LLM to ensure agent instantiation succeeds and dispatches calls in expected order.
- [ ] **Smoke Test**: Run a sample query end-to-end returning structured metadata without exceptions.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Simulate tool failure; agent should capture and return user-friendly error messages.
