## Detailed Story

# Story 1.2.4 – Write Unit Tests for Reddit Tool

## Purpose
Guarantee the Reddit tool’s interface and parsing remain stable through automated testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test suite covers happy path, empty results, API errors, and rate limit responses.
- [ ] Mocks/stubs isolate tests from live Reddit; fixtures stored under `tests/fixtures/reddit/`.
- [ ] Assertions validate shape and content of normalized data.
- [ ] Tests run via `pytest` and pass locally and in CI.
- [ ] Code coverage for `src/tools/reddit_tool.py` exceeds 80%.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Automated Execution**: `pytest tests/test_tools.py::test_reddit_*` completes with exit code 0.
- [ ] **Mutation Testing (optional)**: Run mutmut (or similar) to ensure tests detect intentional faults.
- [ ] **CI Integration**: Confirm test job succeeds on CI pipeline or simulated run.
