## Detailed Story

# Story 1.1.1 – Create GitHub Repository

## Purpose
Establish the canonical source control repository with the agreed scaffold so the team can collaborate using consistent tooling and branch workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Repository exists under the designated GitHub organization or owner.
- [ ] `main` (or `master`) branch contains the scaffolded folder structure documented in `folder-setup.md`.
- [ ] `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, and `.env.example` are present with initial content aligned to project standards.
- [ ] Default branch protection rules and required CI checks are documented or configured per team guidelines.
- [ ] Issues board or project tracking link is referenced in `README.md` or `docs/project-mgmt.md`.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Verification**: Clone the repo on a clean machine and verify the expected files/folders exist at the root.
- [ ] **Configuration Audit**: Run `git status` immediately after clone; expect clean working tree with no untracked files.
- [ ] **Documentation Check**: Confirm `README.md` renders installation instructions without broken links.
