# 4.4.1 – Conduct team knowledge transfer

## Summary (Work Breakdown)

- **Description:** Package learnings, host walkthroughs, and ensure successors can operate and extend the system.
- **Work Package:** 4.4 Team Knowledge Transfer
- **Duration:** 1.5 hours
- **Owner(s):** TBD

- **Context:** As the project wraps, we must reduce single points of failure. This work formalises knowledge sharing across PM, engineering, and design contributors, aligning with the charter’s success criteria (all team members can demo the project).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Schedule and deliver at least one live knowledge-transfer session (recorded) covering architecture, deployment, and maintenance playbooks.
- [ ] Compile FAQs and tribal knowledge into `docs/project-mgmt/knowledge-base.md`, linking to relevant issues and documentation.
- [ ] Create onboarding tasks for new contributors (e.g., GitHub project checklist) and file them under a dedicated “Ramp-Up” section in `issues/`.
- [ ] Establish ownership rotation or support roster for post-launch maintenance (names, responsibilities, contact cadence).

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Attendance & Feedback:** Capture attendee list, collect feedback surveys, and summarise action items in this issue.
- [ ] **Onboarding Drill:** Have a teammate follow the ramp-up checklist and report time-to-first-PR.
- [ ] **Documentation Audit:** Ensure all knowledge transfer materials remain accessible (links not private, recordings stored in shared drive or repo).

## Notes
- Coordinate with Phase 5 maintenance backlog so new owners know how to escalate runtime/dependency issues.
- Consider inviting external stakeholders (mentor/hiring manager) to the session for added polish.
