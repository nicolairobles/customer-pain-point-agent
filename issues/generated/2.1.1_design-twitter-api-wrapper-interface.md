## Detailed Story

# Story 2.1.1 – Design Twitter API wrapper interface

## Purpose
Define a Twitter-specific abstraction that the agent and downstream tooling can rely on for consistent tweet retrieval and normalization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interface contract documented (methods, parameters, return schema) using docstrings or a typed protocol.
- [ ] Normalized fields cover: tweet text, author handle, permalink, created timestamp, like count, repost count, reply count, and language.
- [ ] Authentication strategy specifies required configuration (bearer token, client id/secret) sourced from `config.settings`.
- [ ] Rate limit, pagination, and query parameter options (hashtags, language, time window) are written up with clear guidance.
- [ ] Design walkthrough completed with backend stakeholders and summary captured in the project log.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Design Review**: Walk through at least three representative queries (single keyword, hashtag, and time-bound search) to confirm interface coverage.
- [ ] **Schema Validation**: Produce a sample normalized payload and serialize it to JSON to verify the documented schema.
- [ ] **Traceability**: Update `docs/architecture.md` and the activity entry in `docs/project-mgmt/work-breakdown.md` with any interface decisions.
