# 4.3.1 – Create demo video

## Summary (Work Breakdown)

- **Description:** Script, record, and publish a concise demo video showcasing the agent’s value proposition and key workflows.
- **Work Package:** 4.3 Demo Video Creation
- **Duration:** 2 hours
- **Owner(s):** TBD

- **Context:** A polished demo accelerates stakeholder buy-in and supports job applications. The video should align with the documentation and highlight unique differentiators (multi-source aggregation, UX polish, error resilience).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Draft a storyboard/screenplay covering introduction, live walkthrough, and closing call-to-action; store in `docs/launch/demo-script.md`.
- [ ] Capture high-resolution screen recordings (1080p minimum) demonstrating the query flow, results interpretation, and error handling messaging.
- [ ] Add voice-over or captions (auto-generated + edited) ensuring accessibility and clarity.
- [ ] Produce final edited video (<= 4 minutes) in MP4 format alongside a lightweight thumbnail image.
- [ ] Publish the video to the agreed platform (YouTube unlisted, Loom, or internal share) and link from `README.md`.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Peer Review:** Share the draft video with at least two teammates; incorporate feedback and document approvals.
- [ ] **Quality Check:** Verify audio levels, caption timing, and absence of sensitive data (API keys, personal info).
- [ ] **Playback Test:** Confirm the video streams correctly on desktop and mobile devices.

## Notes
- Reuse assets from the Streamlit UI enhancements to keep the brand consistent.
- Consider adding a short segment about future roadmap (Phase 5) to demonstrate planning maturity.
