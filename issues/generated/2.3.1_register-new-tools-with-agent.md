## Detailed Story

# Story 2.3.1 – Register new tools with agent

## Purpose
Extend the LangChain agent configuration to incorporate the Twitter and Google search tools with appropriate descriptions, arguments, and safety guards.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `src/agent/pain_point_agent.py` (or orchestrator) registers Twitter and Google tools alongside Reddit with human-readable descriptions.
- [ ] Tool metadata documents expected input parameters and output schema for downstream chains.
- [ ] Safety guardrails added to prevent unsupported queries (e.g., overly broad date ranges) and to cap combined result counts.
- [ ] Configuration derives tool enablement flags from environment or settings for feature toggling.
- [ ] Documentation updated in `docs/architecture.md` to reflect the expanded toolchain.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Validate that the agent exposes the expected tool list and raises informative errors for disabled tools.
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Run an agent invocation that exercises all registered tools sequentially and confirms responses aggregated.
- [ ] **Documentation Review**: Peer review architecture updates to ensure traceability of new tool registration.
