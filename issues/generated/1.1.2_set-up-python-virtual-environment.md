## Detailed Story

# Story 1.1.2 – Set Up Python Virtual Environment

## Purpose
Provide an isolated Python runtime with all project dependencies installed to enable reproducible development across contributors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Local environment uses Python 3.11.x as specified in `README.md`.
- [ ] Virtual environment (`.venv` or agreed name) is created and excluded from version control.
- [ ] `pip install -r requirements.txt` completes without errors.
- [ ] `python -m pip list` shows versions matching dependency constraints.
- [ ] Activation and deactivation steps are recorded in `docs/setup.md`.

## Test Criteria
- [x] **Setup Script**: Run documented commands on a clean machine; environment activation succeeds.
- [x] **Dependency Import**: Launch Python shell within the venv and `import langchain`, `streamlit`, `praw` without ImportError.
- [x] **Isolation Check**: Deactivate the venv and confirm project-specific packages are not available globally.
