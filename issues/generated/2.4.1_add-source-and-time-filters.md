## Detailed Story

# Story 2.4.1 – Add source and time filters

## Purpose
Enhance the Streamlit UI to let users refine results by source type and time window before executing agent queries.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UI presents multi-select input for sources (Reddit, Google) with sensible defaults.
- [ ] Users can specify a time filter (last 24h, 7d, 30d, all) that propagates to backend tool calls.
- [ ] Selected filters persisted across sessions using Streamlit session state.
- [ ] Validation prevents submitting when no sources are selected and shows user-friendly guidance.
- [ ] Filter selections logged (without PII) for analytics and troubleshooting.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **UI Test**: Manual walkthrough screenshots/GIF demonstrating filter interactions and disabled submit.
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Backend receives filter parameters and applies them (verified via mocked tool calls).
- [ ] **Usability Review**: Share UI update with product owner (Al) and capture approval comments in project log.
