# 4.2.1 – Complete project documentation

## Summary (Work Breakdown)

- **Description:** Finalise end-user, developer, and operational documentation to support launch and ongoing maintenance.
- **Work Package:** 4.2 Documentation
- **Duration:** 2 hours
- **Owner(s):** TBD

- **Context:** Existing docs cover setup and UI design, but the project needs cohesive guides for stakeholders. This story consolidates scattered notes into a polished documentation set, ensuring new contributors can onboard quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Produce an updated `docs/setup.md` that reflects the deployment workflow, environment variables, and troubleshooting for common install errors.
- [x] Author a user-facing quickstart (`docs/user-guide.md`) with annotated screenshots, usage tips, and known limitations.
- [x] Create a developer architecture overview slide or diagram in `docs/project-mgmt/architecture-diagram.md` (or addendum) that reflects the whole process. As well easy to understand explanation of the technology and processes used to create the overall tool.
- [x] Ensure every major module (`src/agent`, `app/components`, `src/tools`) has up-to-date docstrings and cross-references within the documentation.
- [x] Establish a documentation review checklist (new `docs/project-mgmt/documentation-review.md`) to validate consistency before each release.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Doc Review:** Run the new checklist with at least one peer reviewer; record sign-off in this issue.
- [ ] **Fresh Install Test:** Have a teammate follow the setup guide on a clean machine/environment and capture timing plus stumbling blocks.
- [x] **Link Checker:** Execute a Markdown link checker to ensure all docs reference valid resources (`python scripts/check_markdown_links.py`).

## Notes
- Align with the project charter’s success criteria (shareable demo, documentation completeness).
- Keep screenshots/text free of sensitive data; redact API keys before publishing artifacts.
