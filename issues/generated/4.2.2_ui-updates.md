# 4.2.2 – UI updates (visual identity + onboarding)

## Summary (Work Breakdown)

- **Description:** Add branding and a clearer onboarding/instruction flow to the Streamlit UI.
- **Work Package:** 4.2 Documentation / UX polish
- **Duration:** 1–2 hours
- **Owner(s):** TBD

## Context
The UI should feel more “productized” by adding lightweight branding (logo + concise value proposition) and a first-time-user friendly onboarding block that doesn’t clutter the hero section.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Identity & Page Structure
- [x] **Logo integration:** A professional logo or relevant icon is displayed at the top of the page (using `st.logo` or `st.image`).
- [x] **Descriptive sub-header:** A concise sub-headline (1–2 sentences) is added below the main title to explain the primary value proposition.
- [x] **Reduced text density:** The top of the page is refactored to use whitespace effectively, ensuring the hero section doesn’t feel cluttered.
- [x] **Alignment:** Branding elements are centered or aligned consistently with the rest of the layout.

### User Onboarding & Instructional Flow
- [x] **Onboarding component:** A “How to Use” / “Getting Started” section is implemented using an `st.expander`.
- [x] **Expander state:** The expander is collapsed by default, or expanded only on the first visit.
- [x] **Content specifics:** Instructions explicitly list supported input types (e.g., character limits for text).
- [x] **Visual aids:** Include a small “Good vs. Bad” example to guide user input.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **UI smoke test:** Confirm the hero section (logo/title/subheader + expander) renders cleanly on wide + narrow screens.
- [ ] **Onboarding test:** Verify the expander behavior (first-visit expanded, subsequent runs collapsed).
