## Detailed Story

# Story 1.3.0 – Set Up OpenAI LLM Integration Point

## Purpose
Establish a reusable service layer for invoking OpenAI models within the agent workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Wrapper module encapsulates authentication, model selection, temperature, and token limits.
- [x] Supports both synchronous and asynchronous invocation patterns required by LangChain.
- [x] Implements request/response logging with PII masking and cost tracking hooks.
- [x] Exposes configuration via `config/settings.py` (model name, timeout, retries).
- [x] Error handling covers rate limits, invalid requests, and retries with exponential backoff.

## Test Criteria
- [x] **Unit Tests**: Mock OpenAI client to confirm wrapper handles success, retries, and failures.
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Execute a live call in non-production environment to capture baseline latency and cost.
- [x] **Configuration Test**: Changing model name in `.env` updates runtime behavior without code changes.
