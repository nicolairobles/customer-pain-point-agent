## Detailed Story

# Story 1.4.3 – Implement Results Display Component

## Purpose
Render extracted pain points and metadata in Streamlit with clear hierarchy and interaction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Component displays each pain point with name, description, frequency, examples, and source citations.
- [x] Supports expandable sections or tabs for detailed views and maintains responsiveness.
- [x] Metadata section summarizes total sources searched, execution time, and cost.
- [x] Handles empty states, partial results, and errors gracefully.
- [x] Styling matches the adopted UI template and includes basic theming overrides.

## Test Criteria
- [x] **Unit/Component Tests**: Use sample datasets to ensure rendering logic handles diverse inputs.
- [x] **Manual QA**: Load Streamlit app, verify formatting on desktop and mobile.
- [x] **Accessibility Check**: Confirm headings/ARIA attributes support assistive technologies.

## Status Update (2025-11-26)
- Commit: `feat(streamlit): render results component with tabs and metrics`
- Learning: Normalizing the agent payload into display models keeps Streamlit logic thin and easier to test.
- Learning: Injecting lightweight CSS via `st.markdown` lets the results cards honor the hero layout tokens without a separate stylesheet.
- Preview: `streamlit run scripts/dev_results_preview.py` renders a fixed payload so QA can inspect the UI while the LangChain agent remains incompatible.
- QA: Manual desktop/mobile sweep plus VoiceOver pass completed; story checklists updated.
