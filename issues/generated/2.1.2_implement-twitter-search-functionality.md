## Detailed Story

# Story 2.1.2 – Implement Twitter search functionality

## Purpose
Build the executable Twitter tool that authenticates with Twitter/X APIs, executes searches, and returns normalized tweet data for downstream processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `twitter_tool.py` exposes a callable that accepts query text plus optional filters for hashtags, language, and date range.
- [ ] API authentication uses credentials loaded from `settings.api` and fails fast with descriptive errors when missing.
- [ ] Successful calls return 10–20 tweets per query normalized to the interface described in Story 2.1.1.
- [ ] Rate limiting handled with exponential backoff and retry caps; retries surfaced through structured logging.
- [ ] Inline logging captures request metadata with user identifiers masked or omitted to protect privacy.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Mock Twitter API responses covering success, empty results, and rate-limit errors; verify normalization and error pathways.
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Run a live query using a non-sensitive keyword and confirm all normalized fields are populated.
- [ ] **Performance Test**: Measure execution time over three sample queries; average latency remains under 20 seconds.
