## Detailed Story

# Story 2.2.1 – Configure Google Custom Search

## Purpose
Establish authenticated access to the Google Custom Search API and document configuration so the agent can query the web reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `.env` (local-only) includes placeholders for `GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` with guidance copied to `docs/api_setup.md`.
- [ ] `config.settings` exposes the Google credentials through `settings.api` and validates that values are non-empty at runtime.
- [ ] Smoke script created or extended to verify Google API connectivity with quota-safe queries.
- [ ] Documented rate limits, quota considerations, and cost implications recorded in `docs/api_setup.md`.
- [ ] Team members acknowledge configuration steps in project log or shared checklist.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Configuration Test**: Load settings in a Python REPL to confirm credentials round-trip correctly from environment variables.
- [ ] **Smoke Test**: Run the Google connectivity script and capture output demonstrating response status and result count.
- [ ] **Documentation Review**: Peer review `docs/api_setup.md` changes to ensure clarity and completeness.
