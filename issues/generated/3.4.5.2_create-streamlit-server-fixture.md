# 3.4.5.2 – Create Streamlit Server Fixture

## Summary (Work Breakdown)

- **Description:** Create Streamlit server fixture (auto-start/stop for tests)
- **Work Package:** 3.4.5 E2E Browser Testing
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Story Points:** 2
- **Owner(s):** Dev

## Purpose
Automate Streamlit server lifecycle so E2E tests can run without manual server management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `conftest.py` contains `streamlit_server` fixture with session scope
- [x] Fixture starts Streamlit in headless mode on available port
- [x] Fixture waits for server ready before yielding URL
- [x] Fixture terminates server cleanly after tests complete
- [x] Handles port conflicts gracefully

## Test Criteria
- [x] **Automated Execution**: Multiple tests can run sequentially with same fixture
- [x] **Cleanup**: No orphan Streamlit processes after test suite completes (verified: 0 processes)
