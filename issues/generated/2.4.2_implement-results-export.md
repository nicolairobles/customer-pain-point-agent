## Detailed Story

# Story 2.4.2 – Implement results export

## Purpose
Allow users to export aggregated pain point findings for sharing or follow-up analysis directly from the Streamlit interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UI provides export controls for CSV and JSON formats with clear labels.
- [ ] Export files include query metadata (timestamp, filters, total results) and structured pain point data.
- [ ] Downloads triggered without blocking the main UI thread; errors surfaced with actionable messaging.
- [ ] Export logic redacts sensitive tokens and ensures consistent column ordering.
- [ ] Documentation updated in `README.md` or `docs/setup.md` to describe export usage and limitations.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Validate serialization helpers produce expected CSV/JSON outputs for sample data.
- [ ] **Manual Verification**: Generate exports via Streamlit and open them to confirm formatting and completeness.
- [ ] **Regression Test**: Ensure export toggles hide or disable when no results are available.
