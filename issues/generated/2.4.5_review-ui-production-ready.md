## Detailed Story

# Story 2.4.5 – Review UI for production readiness

## Purpose
Validate that the current Streamlit UI meets production readiness expectations (usability, accessibility, consistency, and resilience), and produce a prioritized feedback report with recommended follow-up tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Perform an end-to-end UI walkthrough (first load → input → analyze → results → error/empty states).
- [ ] Verify visual consistency across reruns (theme, layout, spacing, component hierarchy).
- [ ] Review responsive behavior (mobile/tablet/desktop widths) and note any layout breakpoints/regressions.
- [ ] Review accessibility basics: color contrast, keyboard navigation, focus states, labels/ARIA where relevant.
- [ ] Review copy/tone consistency and user guidance (validation messages, errors, warnings, empty states).
- [x] Identify any “debug-only” UI that should be gated/hidden for production (e.g., debug panels, verbose metadata).
- [x] Produce a written feedback report with: findings, severity (P0/P1/P2), screenshots, and suggested fixes.
- [x] Convert feedback into follow-up issue bullets (or new generated issues) with clear acceptance criteria.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Cross-Browser Sweep**: Validate on Chrome + Safari (or Firefox) for rendering and rerun stability.
- [ ] **Responsive Sweep**: Verify at common widths (≤480px, ~768px, ≥1280px) with screenshots.
- [ ] **State/Rerun Check**: Click Analyze multiple times; confirm no UI regressions or flashing between layouts.
- [ ] **Error/Empty Checks**: Exercise empty input, invalid input, agent unavailable, and partial results messaging.
