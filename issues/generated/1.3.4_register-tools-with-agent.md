## Detailed Story

# Story 1.3.4 – Register Tools with Agent

## Purpose
Ensure all external data source tools are properly registered and discoverable by the LangChain agent.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tool definitions expose accurate `name`, `description`, and argument schemas.
- [ ] Agent registration occurs in a single orchestrator module with isolated configuration logic.
- [ ] Tools can be toggled on/off via settings for debugging or feature flags.
- [ ] Documentation describes how new tools should be added following the same pattern.
- [ ] Telemetry hooks capture which tools were invoked during each run.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Validate tool registry returns expected set given configuration toggles.
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Run agent with each tool enabled individually to confirm compatibility.
- [ ] **Logging Review**: Inspect logs to ensure tool invocation metadata is captured without leaking credentials.
