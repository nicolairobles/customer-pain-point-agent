## Detailed Story

# Story 1.2.2 – Implement Reddit Search Functionality

## Purpose
Deliver the concrete implementation of the Reddit search tool that fetches relevant discussions for the agent.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `reddit_tool.py` exposes a method that accepts query text and optional filters (subreddits, time range, result count).
- [ ] Implementation authenticates using credentials from `settings.api`.
- [ ] Returns 5–10 results per query with normalized fields defined in the interface story.
- [ ] Handles rate limiting via retries/backoff and surfaces errors with actionable messages.
- [ ] Includes inline logging for request metadata masked for security.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Add mocked PRAW responses verifying transformation and error handling.
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Run against live Reddit with a test query, confirming response structure and rate limit compliance.
- [ ] **Performance Test**: Measure execution time; average call completes under configured timeout (<=30s).
