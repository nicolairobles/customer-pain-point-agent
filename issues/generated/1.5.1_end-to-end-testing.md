## Detailed Story

# Story 1.5.1 – End-to-End Testing

## Purpose
Validate the full system workflow from user query input through data retrieval, extraction, and presentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test plan covers representative user scenarios, edge cases, and failure modes.
- [ ] Automated E2E test script (e.g., using Playwright or Streamlit testing API) executes the workflow.
- [ ] Results logged with timestamps, dataset identifiers, and pass/fail outcomes.
- [ ] Issues discovered are documented with reproduction steps and assigned owners.
- [ ] Test artifacts (screenshots, logs) stored in shared location for audit trail.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Automation Run**: Execute end-to-end script; expect successful completion with verified outputs.
- [ ] **Manual Validation**: Cross-check at least one automated run manually to confirm correctness.
- [ ] **Regression Schedule**: Define cadence (e.g., nightly) and ensure test integrates with CI pipeline.
