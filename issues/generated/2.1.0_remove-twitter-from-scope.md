# 2.1.0 – Remove Twitter/X from project scope

## Summary

- **Description:** De-scope Twitter/X due to API constraints; remove integration points and update docs/tests.
- **Work Package:** 3.1.x Scope Adjustment
- **Duration:** 1–2 hours
- **Story Points:** 2
- **Owner(s):** Nicolai

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Twitter/X is no longer referenced as an active data source in the product (README, docs, UI copy).
- [ ] Twitter credentials are removed from configuration defaults and `.env.example`.
- [ ] Twitter tool code is removed (or fully disabled and not imported anywhere).
- [ ] Test suite no longer imports or expects `TwitterTool`.
- [ ] Requirements no longer include Twitter-specific dependencies (e.g., `tweepy`).

## Notes
- If we still want **3 sources**, create a follow-up issue to add a replacement source (e.g., Hacker News, Product Hunt, forums).
