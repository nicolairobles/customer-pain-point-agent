## Detailed Story

# Story 1.1.3 – Obtain OpenAI API Key

## Purpose
Secure authorized access to OpenAI services to support LLM-powered pain point extraction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OpenAI account is active with billing configured within project budget (<$15 target).
- [ ] API key is generated and stored securely in local `.env` using the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable.
- [ ] Key storage follows team security practices (no plaintext commits, password manager entry).
- [ ] `docs/api_setup.md` updated with any organization-specific instructions or constraints.
- [ ] An audit log entry is captured in project management tooling noting key owner and creation date.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] **Smoke Test**: Execute a minimal script using the OpenAI client (e.g., `python scripts/openai_smoke.py`) returning a response.
- [ ] **Security Check**: Run `git status` to ensure `.env` is not tracked; verify `.gitignore` excludes it.
- [ ] **Documentation Review**: Confirm `docs/api_setup.md` lists the key location and rotation cadence.
